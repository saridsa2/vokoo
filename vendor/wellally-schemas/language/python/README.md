**Website:** https://www.wellally.tech/

## Installation

```bash
pip install wellally
```

## Features

- 🏥 **Lab Reports**: Structured laboratory test results with LOINC codes
- 🔬 **Imaging Reports**: Diagnostic imaging reports with DICOM support
- 💊 **Medications**: Medication records with RxNorm codes
- 👤 **Personal Health**: Individual health records following FHIR standards
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Health**: Family health trees for genetic tracking

## Usage

### Lab Report Example

```python
from wellally import LabReport, LabResult, CodeableConcept, Coding, Quantity
from datetime import datetime

# Create a lab result
result = LabResult(
    code=CodeableConcept(
        coding=[Coding(
            system="http://loinc.org",
            code="2339-0",
            display="Glucose"
        )]
    ),
    value=Quantity(value=95.0, unit="mg/dL"),
    interpretation="N"
)

# Create a lab report
report = LabReport(
    id="lab-001",
    patientId="patient-123",
    issuedAt=datetime.now(),
    results=[result]
)
```

### Personal Health Record Example

```python
from wellally import Person, HumanName
from datetime import date

person = Person(
    id="patient-123",
    name=[HumanName(
        family="Zhang",
        given=["San"]
    )],
    birthDate=date(1990, 1, 1),
    gender="male"
)
```

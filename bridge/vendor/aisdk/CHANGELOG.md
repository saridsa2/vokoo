## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

- Added support for SubAgents
- Added support for custom HTTP headers in `LanguageModelRequest`, allowing request header injection and overriding provider default headers. by [@gaki2](https://github.com/gaki2)
- Added support for custom HTTP headers in `EmbeddingModelRequest`, allowing request header injection and overriding provider default headers.
- Add grok-4-20-beta as a model in xAI provider.
- Added support for custom HTTP request body for `LanguageModelRequest` and all providers, allowing request body injection and overriding provider default body. by [@gaki2](https://github.com/gaki2)
- Added support for custom HTTP request body for `EmbeddingModelRequest`, and for all providers, allowing request body injection and overriding provider default body.
- Added Provider level HTTP headers to `LanguageModelRequest` and `EmbeddingModelRequest`. allowing request header injection on provider intialization.
- Added async tool executor support through `ToolExecute::from_async(...)`.
- Added support for `#[tool] pub async fn ...` tool bodies.
- Added `ToolContext` for tools, enabling runtime-aware execution and access to `LanguageModelOptions`.
- Added optional tool stream sender support in `ToolContext`, allowing tools to emit `LanguageModelStreamChunkType` from the tool body.
- Added new `LanguageModelStreamChunkType` chunk types: `ReasoningStart`, `ReasoningDelta`, `ReasoningEnd`, `ToolCallStart`, `ToolCallDelta`, `ToolCallAvailable`, and `ToolCallEnd`
- Added ToolCall progress stream support for vercel-ai-sdk-ui integration.

### Changed

- `ToolExecute` now uses a trait-based executor abstraction internally, allowing both synchronous and asynchronous tool executors behind the same `Tool` API.
- `ToolExecute::call(...)` is now async and must be awaited. This is a breaking change for direct callers of the tool executor API.
- `ToolList::execute(...)` and `ToolExecute::call(...)` is now async, takes `ToolContext` as the first parameter as the first parameter for runtime-aware execution.
- Removed `ToolExecute::new(...)` in favor of the explicit `from_sync(...)` and `from_async(...)` constructors.
- `Start` and `End` language model stream chunk types are now `TextStart` and `TextEnd`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Fixed `DynamicModel` builder bug where `.model_name(...)` was overwritten on `.build()`, causing empty model IDs.

### Added

- Added optional jitter feature flag for backoff jitter (pulls in fastrand)
- Added separate shared connection pools
- Added retry logic for transport-level errors (timeout, connection refused)

### Changed

- Switched TLS backend from native-tls to rustls (removes OpenSSL dependency)
- Reduced default max_retries from 5 to 3, initial_wait from 1s to 500ms and reduced default max_wait from 30s to 20s

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- Added `DynamicModel`, `model_name()` methods to set model name dynamically
- Added `Vercel AI Gateway` provider
- Added `OpenRouter` provider
- Added `DeepSeek` provider
- Added `Amazon Bedrock` provider
- Added `TogetherAI` provider
- Added `XAI` provider

### Changed

- Changed Groq provider to use OpenAI's ChatCompletions API

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- Added `Messages` type alias for `Vec<Message>`.
- Added seamless integration to work with vercel's ai-sdk-ui.
- Added seamless integration to work with axum + vercel's ai-sdk ui.
- Added Google provider
- Added `Extensions` struct for attaching provider-specific metadata to core SDK structures
- Async accessor methods to `StreamTextResponse` for thread-safe data retrieval (`messages()`, `steps()`, `usage()`, etc.)
- Added `builder()` method for `Tool` for easier construction
- `tool` macro is now re-exported from the main `aisdk` crate for easier access
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors (429)

### Changed

- Model capabilities are now enforced at compile time via marker traits, preventing invalid feature usage (e.g., tool calls on unsupported models).
- Updated tool macro to require a return type of `Tool`
- User does not need to import `aisdk::core::tools::ToolExecute` anymore to work with the tool macro
- `LanguageModel` trait now requires `Clone + 'static` bounds (all providers must implement `Clone`)
- Streaming implementation now uses `tokio::sync::mpsc` instead of `std::sync::mpsc`
- Import path for `tool` macro has changed from `use aisdk_macros::tool` to `use aisdk::macros::tool`
- `Error::ApiError` now uses a struct with `status_code: Option<StatusCode>` and `details: String` fields
- `LanguageModelResponseContentType::Reasoning` now includes an `extensions` field for provider-specific metadata

### Removed

- Removed the tool macro re-export from `src/core/mod.rs`. User should use `aisdk_macros::tool` directly
- Removed async-openai dependency
- `Clone` implementation from `LanguageModelRequest<M>`
- `Deref` implementation from `StreamTextResponse` (direct field access no longer works)

### Fixed

- `aisdk-macros` `#[tool]` function unused variable warning even though it is used
- Anthropic provider API endpoint path corrected from `/messages` to `/v1/messages`
- Anthropic provider serialization/deserialization issues with tool calls
- Stream reliability issues that caused premature termination

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-02

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- Hooks (StopWhen, OnStepStart, OnStepFinish) for Language Model Requests
- Reasoning message and configuration options
- Anthropic provider
- Groq provider

### Changed

- Changed standalone (generate_text,stream_text) functions to methods on LanguageModelRequest struct
- Rebranded to aisdk

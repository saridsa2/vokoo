//! The base STT trait: a *wire-protocol adapter*, nothing more.
//!
//! A provider answers four questions and owns no state machine:
//!
//!   1. Where do I connect, and with what headers?  ([`SttProvider::handshake`])
//!   2. How do I frame a chunk of PCM for this API?  ([`SttProvider::encode_audio`])
//!   3. How do I ask for a final transcript?         ([`SttProvider::finalize_msg`])
//!   4. What does this server message mean?          ([`SttProvider::parse`])
//!
//! Everything else — the WebSocket tasks, the turn gate, audio enhancement,
//! billing, and the single [`FrameHandler`](crate::frames::FrameHandler) impl —
//! lives in [`SttService`](super::driver::SttService), which is generic over
//! this trait. Adding a provider is therefore a protocol exercise, not a
//! concurrency one.
//!
//! Provider-specific configuration (Sarvam's `mode`, Deepgram's `endpointing`,
//! 60db's language list) stays in the provider's own config struct. None of it
//! belongs here.
